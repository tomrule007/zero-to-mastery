// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.  

var firstNum = prompt('Enter the first number: ');
var secondNum = prompt('Enter the second number: ');
var sum = Number(firstNum) + Number(secondNum);
alert(`The Sum of ${firstNum} + ${secondNum} = ${sum}`);
// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!
