    <h1>Ramblings</h1>
    <p>
      I have thought about starting a blog many times now. For now the decision
      remains to keep my written thoughts private in my journals. I'm trying to
      be deliberate with my time and currently a public Blog isnt in the
      numbers...

    <p><strong>Maybe Next year...</strong> no one knows for sure.</p>
